## Project Name
Note Taker

## Description
The Note Taker is a Node.js command-line application that allows users to utilize the Note Taker application and be presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.  When the user clicks on the link to the notes page, the user is shown a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.  When the user enters a new note title and the note’s text, the "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page.  When the user clicks on the Save button, the new note the user has entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes, and the buttons in the navigation disappear.   When the user clicks on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN, that note appears in the right-hand column, and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation.  
When the user clicks on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page, the user is presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column, and the button disappears.
